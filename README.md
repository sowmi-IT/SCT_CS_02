Here's a simple Python tool for image encryption using pixel manipulation. It swaps pixel values and applies basic mathematical operations on the pixel values (like addition, subtraction, etc.) to "encrypt" and "decrypt" the image.

We'll use the Python Pillow library to load and manipulate the image pixels.

Steps:
Image Loading: We'll load the image using Pillow.
Pixel Manipulation: We'll swap pixel values or apply basic operations like adding a constant value to each pixel's RGB values.
Encrypt and Decrypt Functions: Functions to encrypt (modify) the image and decrypt (reverse the modifications) it.
